# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Deep Learning
Credit card fraud poses significant financial risks to companies and users, and is a big challenge in the era of digital transactions. This project aims to enhance the detection of credit card fraud by employing and comparing multiple deep learning models to identify the most effective approach with the best AUC Precision-Recall and least overfitting. Once the best model is found, it can be deployed to detect future frauds in real-time, increasing trust in financial transactions. The three models tested are CNNs, RNNs, and MLPs, with each utilizing optimal parameters found via bayesian optimization.
